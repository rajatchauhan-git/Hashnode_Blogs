Kubernetes has become the go-to platform for deploying and managing containerized applications, and mastering its storage and security aspects is crucial for any DevOps professional. This guide provides an in-depth look at Persistent Volumes (PVs), Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), Storage Classes, StatefulSets, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Secrets, Network Policies, and Transport Layer Security (TLS).

---

### Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)

#### **Persistent Volumes (PVs)**

Persistent Volumes (PVs) are storage units in a Kubernetes cluster that exist independently of any Pod. PVs can be provisioned manually or dynamically using Storage Classes and can utilize different storage backends like NFS, iSCSI, or cloud provider solutions.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*jhmJfMex6PRVSKyP3mo2Jw.png align="left")

**Creating a Persistent Volume:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  nfs:
    path: /exported/path
    server: nfs-server.example.com
```

Apply the configuration with:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f pv.yml
```

This creates a PV backed by an NFS server, with 5Gi of storage accessible by a single node.

#### **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**

PVCs are how users request storage in Kubernetes. A PVC will bind to a matching PV based on the size and access mode requested.  

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*_Y-AiPWenkufyD2G1IKIAg.png align="left")

**Creating a Persistent Volume Claim:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```

Apply with:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f pvc.yml
```

**Using PVCs in Pods:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
          name: my-storage
  volumes:
    - name: my-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: my-pvc
```

Deploy the Pod with:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f pod.yml
```

This configuration mounts the PVC at `/usr/share/nginx/html` in the NGINX container.  
  
**Short Name**

```yaml
$ kubectl api-resources
NAME                   SHORTNAMES APIVERSION        NAMESPACED KIND
persistentvolumeclaims pvc        v1                true       PersistentVolumeClaim
persistentvolumes      pv         v1                false      PersistentVolume
storageclasses         sc         storage.k8s.io/v1 false      StorageClass
```

---

### Storage Classes

#### **Overview**

Storage Classes allow administrators to define different storage profiles, enabling dynamic PV provisioning with specific characteristics like performance and replication.

**Creating a Storage Class:**

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: fast-storage
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  type: io1
  iopsPerGb: "10"
  fsType: ext4
```

Apply with:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f storageclass.yml
```

**Using a Storage Class with a PVC:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: fast-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: fast-storage
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

Deploy the PVC with:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f pvc-with-sc.yml
```

This PVC requests 10Gi of storage from the `fast-storage` class.

---

### StatefulSets

#### **Overview**

StatefulSets are designed for stateful applications, ensuring stable identities for Pods, ordered deployment, and storage persistence. Each Pod in a StatefulSet has its own PVC, guaranteeing data consistency.

**Deploying a StatefulSet:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  serviceName: "nginx"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: k8s.gcr.io/nginx-slim:0.8
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: www
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: www
    spec:
      accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

Apply the StatefulSet with:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f statefulset.yml
```

Each Pod will have a dedicated PVC for its data.

---

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## **Node Authorization**

> *In a Kubernetes cluster, each node runs a kubelet process that communicates with the Kubernetes API server to manage pods and containers running on that node. The kubelet process is responsible for reporting the status of the node and its containers, and for executing commands and pulling images from the container registry.*

Node Authorization is a specific type of authorization mode in Kubernetes that is used to **authorize API requests made by Kubelets**. It is **not** intended for **user authorization**.

To be authorized by the Node authorizer, a kubelet must use a credential that identifies it as a member of the `system:nodes` **group** and has a specific **username** format of `system:node:<nodeName>`. Therefore, when a kubelet makes an API request to the Kubernetes API server, it includes this [TLS cer](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d)[tificate as part](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d) of it[s credentials,](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d) along with the `system:node:<nodeName>` username and `system:nodes` group. The Node authorizer verifies these credentials to ensure that the kubelet is authorized to make the requested API call.

node authorization

## **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**

Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) **uses attributes** to **dete**[**rmine if a user**](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d) **or process has access to a resource**. These policies consist of rules that match attributes in a user’s request with attributes in the policy.

ABAC (Attribute-[Based Access Co](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d)ntrol)

However, **managing and updating ABAC policies can become complex**, especially as the number of policies and attributes increase. This can lead to potential difficulties in maintaining the system over time.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*m9EeEmIsFObR5DBLFPjBOA.png align="left")

ABAC drawback

## **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a **widely adopted authorization mode** in Kubernetes that allows cluster administrators to **create roles and bind them to users, groups, or service accounts**. **Roles** define **a set of specific permissions**, while **role** [**bindings attach**](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d) **thes**[**e roles to the**](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d) **appropriate entities**, gr[anting administ](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d)rators precise control over resource access. When changes are required to user access, administrators can easily modify the assigned role, which is immediately reflected across all users assigned to that r[ole. Unlike ABA](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d)C, RBAC provides a simpl[er and **more sca**](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d)**lable approach** to managing access by allowing administrators to define specific roles and permissions for different entities.

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

We will dive deeper into RBAC [in the next story.](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d)

## [**Webhook**](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d)

Webhook authorizati[on mode allows](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d) for **custom authorization logic** by **delegating the authorization decision to an external HTTP service**, known as a webhook.

When a user or process sends a request to the Kubernetes API server, the server sends a webhook authorization request to the external authorizer. The authorizer evaluates the request against the defined policies and sends a **callback response** indicating whether **the request is authorized or not**. This enables Kubernetes administrators to implement complex and customized authorization rules specific to their organization’s needs using any external system for making authorization decisions, such as an LDAP or Active Directory server, a database, or custom code.

Webh[ook](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d)

## [**AlwaysAllo**](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d)**w**

AlwaysAllow mode [**allows all req**](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d)**uests** without any further authoriza[tion checks. This mode c](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d)an be useful in certain development or testing environments, where ease of access is prioritized over security. However, it is **not recommende**[**d** for use **in pr**](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d)**oduction environments**.

## **AlwaysDeny**

AlwaysDeny mode **denies all requests** without any further authorization checks. This mode can be useful in highly secure environments where strict access control is critical, or in situations where authorization is not required at all.

# **Configure Authorization Modes**

1. Edit the **kube-apiserver.yaml** configuration file located at **/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml**
    
2. Add the desired authorization mode to the --**authorization-mode** flag, separating multiple modes with commas.
    

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*RAhQAw2nT_SSFkTyF30ymQ.png align="left")

configure authorization mo[des](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d)

[For example, to enable RBAC and](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d) Webhook modes, add the following line under the kube-apiserver command:

```
--authorization-mode=RBAC,Webhook
```

3\. Save the configuration file and restart the kube-apiserver process to apply the changes.

# **Multiple Authorization Modes**

Multiple Authorization M[odes allows cluster adminis](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d)trators to **use more than one authorization mode** to secure access to Kubernetes resources. When a user makes a request to the Kubernetes API server, **each authorization mode is evaluated in order until one of them successf**[**ully authorizes**](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d) **or denies the req**[**uest**. If all mo](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d)des fail, the request is denied.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*l93xhONL-3tAB8QNTvV8lA.png align="left")

**Creating a Role:**

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

[Apply the](https://medium.com/@yuminlee2/kubernetes-tls-certificates-b75fee80670d) Role with:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f role.yml
```

**Binding a Role to a User:**

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: ojas
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Apply the RoleBinding with:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f rolebinding.yml
```

The user `ojas` now has read-only access to Pods in the default namespace.

### Secrets

#### **Overview**

Secrets securely store sensitive information like passwords, API tokens, and SSH keys. They can be used to inject environment variables or mount them as files in Pods.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*GX7tL0ZsAgub_NNuziwjCg.png align="left")

# **Secret**

In Kubernetes, Secrets are API objects used to **store sensitive information**, such as passwords, tokens, and keys. They are used in a similar way to ConfigMaps but are **encoded in base64 format**. Secrets can be used to **separate sensitive data from application code** and make it **easier to manage and modify the data independently** of the application. Secrets can be consumed by Pods as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume.

In a restaurant, a **secure pantry** is like a Secret in Kubernetes that stores valuable and confidential ingredients such as truffles, saffron, and caviar. This pantry is different from general pantries because it has strict access controls and security measures to prevent unauthorized access or theft.

# **Secret Data is Not Encrypted**

**Secret** **data** in Kubernetes is **stored in base64 format**, which is **not an encryption mechanism**. This means that **the encoded data can be easily decoded back to its original form**, making it unsuitable for storing highly sensitive information.

One way to **improve the security of Secrets** is to use **encryption**. Kubernetes provides the ability to [encrypt Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/) [at rest using a feature called](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/) **EncryptionConfig**. EncryptionConfig allows you to encrypt sensitive data in Kubernetes using a **data encryption key**. When you create a Secret, Kubernetes will automatically encrypt the data using the encryption key, and store it in etcd in an encrypted format.

Another best practice is to use **external secret management systems,** such as Vault or Azure Key Vault, to store and manage sensitive data.

# **Encode and Decode in Base64**

## [**encode a**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/) **string**

> `-n` : no trailing newline

```yaml
$ echo -n "<string>" | base64
```

example:

```yaml

output: aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=
```

## **decode a base64-encoded string**

$ echo -n "<base64_encoded_string>" | base64 -d
```

exampl[e:](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/)

```yaml
$ echo -n "aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=" | base64 --decode
hello world
```

# **Secret with YAML**

Two steps to work with Secret in Kubernetes.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Z4HGiA9En9CInMvsFgdkKw.png align="left")

Secret with YAML

## **1\. Create a Secret Object**

secret.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metedata:
  name: <secret_name>
data:
  <key1>: <base64_encoded_value1>
  <key2>: <base64_encoded_value2>
        :
  <keyM>: <base64_encoded_valueM>
```

Run `kubectl create`command to create a new Secret object.

## **2\. Inject Secret to Pod**

**2.1 Environment variables**

* Configure with **all key-value pairs** in a Secret
    

pod.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: <pod_name>
  namespace: <namespace_name>
  labels:
    <key1>: <value1>
    <key2>: <value2>
           :
           :
    <keyN>: <valueN>
spec:
  containers:
    - name: <container_name>
      image: <image>
      envFrom:
      - secreteRef:
          name: <secret_name>
```

* [Configure](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/) with [a **specified key-value pair** from a Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/)
    

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: <pod_name>
  namespace: <namespace_name>
  labels:
    <key1>: <value1>
    <key2>: <value2>
           :
           :
    <keyN>: <valueN>
spec:
  containers:
    - name: <container_name>
      image: <image>
      env:
        - name: <environment_variable_name>
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: <secret_name>
              key: <key_in_secret>
```

[**2.2 Volume**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/)

[po](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/)d.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: <pod_name>
  namespace: <namespace_name>
  labels:
    <key1>: <value1>
    <key2>: <value2>
           :
           :
    <keyN>: <valueN>
spec:
  containers:
    - name: <container_name>
      image: <image>
      volumeMounts:
      - name: <volume_name>
        mountPath: <mount_path>
  volumes:
    - name: <volume_name>
      secret:
        secretName: <secret_name>
```

### Network Policies

# **Ingress and Egress Traffic**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*0iq09Km7iVy1BlpLkLe6iw.png align="left")

ingress and egress traffic

**Ingress** **traffic** refers to the **incoming network traffic** that is **directed to a pod or a group of pods** in the Kubernetes cluster. For example, if a user outside the cluster sends a request to a pod within the cluster, the traffic would be considered ingress traffic to that pod.

**Egress traffic**, on the other hand, refers to the **outgoing network traffic** **from a pod or a group of pods** in the Kubernetes cluster. For example, if a pod in the cluster sends a request to a service or an external endpoint outside the cluster, the traffic would be considered egress traffic from that pod.

# **Network Policies**

**By default**, Kubernetes clusters allow **unrestricted communication between pods and external access**, which can pose security risks, especially in multi-tenant environments where multiple applications and teams coexist.

**NetworkPolicy** is a **Kubernetes object** that allows you to create policies that **define how pods can communicate with each other and with external entities within a specific namespace**. NetworkPolicy rules can be based on various factors such as IP addresses, ports, protocols, and labels, enabling you to restrict traffic to specific pods or groups of pods based on your security requirements.

# **Short Name: netpol**

```yaml
$ kubectl api-resources
NAME             SHORTNAMES   APIVERSION            NAMESPACED  KIND
networkpolicies  netpol       networking.k8s.io/v1  true        NetworkPolicy
```

# **NetworkPolicy with YAML**

## **podSelector**

The `podSelector` field **selects pods based on their labels** and determines which pods the policy applies to.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*8HTW8sqUGy40L5FYpuo8cA.png align="left")

podSelector

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: backend-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      name: backend
  policyTypes:    
    - Ingress    
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
            name: frontend
      ports:
        - port: 8080
          protocol: TCP
  egress:
    - to:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
            name: database
      ports:
        - port: 5432
          protocol: TCP
```

In this case, this NetworkPolicy targets pods labeled with `name: backend`. The `ingress` section defines **incoming traffic rules** from `name: frontend` pods on `port` 8080. The `egress` section defines **outgoing traffic rules** to `name: database` pods on `port` 5432.

## **namespaceSelector**

`namespaceSelector` is a field that allows you to **select particular namespaces** and **apply network policy rules to all the pods within those namespaces**.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*4JD6O80WuPWaD-04KMOAQw.png align="left")

namespaceSelector

```yaml
...
ingress:
  - from:
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
          name: namespace1
    ports:
      - port: 8080
        protocol: TCP
...
```

In this case, it allows traffic from the pods in `namespace1`.

## **ipBlock**

`ipBlock` is a field used to **specify IP address blocks** that are **allowed to access or denied access to the pod**. It can be used to define a CIDR block or a single IP address.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*aHp22HbOOUoPkO0yYL1EgQ.png align="left")

ipBlock

```yaml
...
ingress:
  - from:
      - ipBlock:
          cidr: 192.168.0.0/16
    ports:
      - port: 8080
        protocol: TCP
...
```

In this example, the `ipBlock` field is used to specify the CIDR block `192.168.0.0/16`. The `ingress` section allows incoming traffic to the pod on `port` 8080 using the TCP protocol only if the source IP address is within this CIDR block.

### [Transport Layer Sec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/)urity (TLS)

# **TLS Certificates**

TLS certificates are utilized in Kubernetes to **secure communication** between various components within a Kubernetes cluster. Each component has its own **digital certificate issued by a trusted third-party organization** known as a **Certificate Authority (CA)**. These certificates enable components to **authenticate their identities** when communicating with one another, ensuring that only authorized entities can access sensitive data or services.

To **verify the identity of other components**, **each component needs to have a copy of the CA’s public certificate**. This public certificate is used to verify that the digital certificate presented by **the other component is valid and was issued by the same trusted CA**. This ensures that the communication between components is secure and that sensitive data or services are protected.

## **Client Certificates**

A client certificate is used to **identify a client or user** who is accessing a Kubernetes cluster or its components.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*TOtUhbACHK9buiEtowQXiw.png align="left")

Client certificates

## **Server Certificates**

A server certificate is used to **identify a Kubernetes component**, such as the **API server, etcd, or kubelet**.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*fvprPoK8I1HlJir1ctvVVg.png align="left")

**Generating TLS Certificates:** Use OpenSSL to create a certificate:

```yaml
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj "/CN=my-app/O=my-org"
```

**Creating a TLS Secret:**

```yaml
kubectl create secret tls my-tls-secret --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key
```

**Using TLS in Ingress:**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: tls-ingress
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - my-app.example.com
